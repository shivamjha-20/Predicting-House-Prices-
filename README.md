# Predicting-House-Prices
This project aims to predict house prices using a Linear Regression model based on various features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more. The dataset used is sourced from [House Data](link_to_data), containing detailed information about houses including their prices.

## Overview
The project involves predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. It starts with preprocessing the data to handle missing values and encoding categorical variables. Then, it explores the relationships between features and the target variable through visualizations and correlation analysis. A Linear Regression model is trained on the dataset to predict house prices.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values by dropping irrelevant columns and filling missing values in others.
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Utilized visualizations like heatmaps to understand feature relationships.
- Analyzed feature distributions and their impact on house prices.

## Model Training
- Selected features and target variable for training the Linear Regression model.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Built and trained the Linear Regression model.

## Results
- Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Squared Error and R-squared.
- Visualized predictions against actual prices and created a residual plot to assess model performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of Linear Regression for predicting house prices based on various features. The model achieved [accuracy/evaluation metric] and provides insights into factors influencing house prices. Future work could involve exploring other machine learning algorithms and fine-tuning model parameters for improved performance.
